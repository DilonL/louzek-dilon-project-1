                <p>The Bench is designed to be a fun Interactive seating allowing multiple people(18) to sit, ride, and seesaw as a group confortably. This was made during my internship in Sicily were we were tasked to remodel and redesign and rundown convent as well as demostrate the convention of repurposing abandoned material to make useful objects. The Bench structure is made out of three main element the base, the seat holders, and the seats. the base which the seesaw rocks on is a wooden peice of gym equipment in the shape of an arched ladder. The seat holder is a thick wooden ladder. The seats are made up of three back rest and one seat plate, and are designed to be shock absorbent to make the ride more smoother. Other parts include the foot rest made out of back rest plates, luber to reinforce the structure.</p>
